Documentation C-Control 2 Pachube

Connecting sensors to internet services is not a mirical at all. Here
is my tiny example. I use the embedded controller C-Control I Version
1.1 with the starter board from Conrad, three sensors from Conrad, my
windows PC, and a service from pachube to feed sensor data in the web.

For a quick view on C-Control and the additional Starter Board please
see the doc folder. Detailed information about pachube is available on
the community server.

Please download the C-Control2pachube source code. Please take care to
install the required libraries before you can run the java code:

* eeml available at www.eeml.org
* processing.core library available at www.processing.org
* gnu.io serial port access library which is also part of the processing library
* serial run time rxtxSerial.dll which is also part of the processing library

The sensor feed is not available any more as I turned off the hardware.
